## Reporting a Vulnerability

When you find a vulnerability, please report it by emailing to eduvpn@surfnet.nl

Please use proper disclosure proces. Most likely we will ask you to create a pull request, or we create one based on your input.

Once the pull request is public, feel free to share your experience and results through your own channels.

It could be that we fix your issue silently and request you to stay silent until a fix is live. We are thankful for any issues raised and we will work with you to come to a proper and correct resolution.
